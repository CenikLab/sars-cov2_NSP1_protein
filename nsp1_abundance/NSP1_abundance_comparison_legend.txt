Figure Legend: Comparison of NSP1 gene expression accross different studies. RNA-Seq data from this study and two publicly available datasets are mapped to NSP1 sequence and the transcriptome. Each point comes from an experiment from the study indicated in the x-axis. The number of reads mapping to NSP1 were normalized as follows. For each experiment, the number of reads mapping to NSP1 were divided by the total number of mapped reads in that experiment, and then multiplied by 1 million. This gave us the number of reads per million on the y-axis. The studies on the x-axis, from left to right, are as follows. HEK293T and H1299 are the sets of experiments, used in this study, where HEK293T and H1299 cells were transfected with NSP1 or NSP2 vectors. GSE150316 contains autopsy samples from deceased beacuse of SARS-Cov2 infection. Only samples from the lungs were used in this comparison. GSE159191 A549 and GSE159191 HEK293T contain experiments from lung carcinoma cells and human embryonic kidney cells, respectively, where cells were either transfected with the SARS-Cov2 virus or untrasfected. GSE150316 and GSE159191 indicate the NCBI GEO accession numbers of the publicly available studies.
