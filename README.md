# Supplementary Files of Cenik Lab's Sars-Cov2 NSP1 Protein Study

This repository contains supplementary files, scripts and notebooks of our manuscript entitled
[Genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts preferentially escape global suppression of translation by the SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 protein](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.13.295493v1).


## NSP1 and NSP2 Sequences

We used codon-optimized sequences for NSP1 and NSP2 vecotrs. 
[Their sequences](https://github.com/CenikLab/sars-cov2_NSP1_protein/blob/main/reference_sequences/nsp1_nsp2.fa.gz) are also provided in this repository under *reference_sequences* folder.
